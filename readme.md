## Project Plan

As population aging becomes one of the most critical issues in many developed countries while developing countries can not afford their growing population pressures, we expect to study and predict the birth population and the degree of aging for each country. 

### Objective:

First and foremost, we would like to predict birth rate for each country with time series models (eg. ARIMA), considering that there is a demographic cycle.  
Also, we will judging aging levels for countries based on UN standards, and predict 10-year-later aging levels by classification models (eg. Decision Tree, XGBoost, Random Forest) and various predictors.


### EDA:
Cycle/Time Pattern of birth rate for each country, White Noise test
Correlations - aging level

## Why Project?
Nowadays, a lot of countries, especially developed countries, are facing the problem of low birth rates, while some developing countries are suffering from high birth rates. We will explore the contributing factors of birth rates, which will be used to predict the future situation. Since population aging is to some extent related to low birth rates, we are also going to predict the level of population aging five years from now based on the prediction outcome of our first model.  According to the prediction of population aging, governments are able to put forward reasonable policies to respond to the lack of medical resources and economic stagnation in the future or even slow down the aging of the population.
